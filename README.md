# CSS tricks

This is a git repository for storing some CSS learning tricks, nothing more.
Most of them are Pure CSS but some work with JS.
Some are just dumb applied concepts but others are bloody cool stuff!

They are fun and quite creative!
I learned them from articles and blogs I've found on web.

One of my favourites is [The new code](https://thenewcode.com) by Dudley Storey. He can teach a lot about HTML5, CSS3, JS, SVG, Responsive Design and so on.

And, sure, I also cannot forget to mention [Chris Coyer](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/). He has incredible Web knowledge and writing skill. His website [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/) is likely to be much more updated than Dudley's.


## What have I practiced or learned?
**TL;DR** In a few words: Progressive JS, CSS tricks, UI components and CSS effects such as 2D and 3D Carousel, different kinds of gallery using shadow, flip and other crazy effects. Furthermore, animations, canvas, generated images with captions, flexbox and grid, responsive design, parallax effect, navbar and sliders, accordion menus, text clip, filters, blend modes, transitions, hover effects, layouts, and many more!

## Let's cut the cheese right way!

Following below I present a list of interesting Pure CSS (or with just a bit of JS) effects and UI elements.

They are ***HTML files*** and can be **viewed directly in the browser**. So, use the Devtools of your favourite browser for checking the code or [go directly to this repo](https://github.com/trepichio/Mytest) and see all source code.
